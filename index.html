        <article class="content">
           <p> Doctor Strange is a character that lives in Marvel Universe. Serves as Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats.
            He is first introduced as a brilliant but egotistically arrogant neurosurgeon who is injured in a car accident.
            He is told that medical therapy and rehabilitation won't be enough for his full recovery to go back to work, so, unable to accept this prognosis, he travels the world searching for alternative ways of healing, which leads him to the Ancient One, the Sorcerer Supreme.
            Then, he becomes his student and learns to be a master of both the mystical and the martial arts.
            He acquires an assortment of mystical objects, including the powerful Eye of Agamotto, and the Cloak of Levitation, then takes up residence in a mnsion referred to as the Sanctum Sanctorum, located in New York City.
            Strange assumes the title of Sorcerer Supreme, and, with his friend Wong, defends the world from mystical threats.

        <article class="content">
            <p>Doctor Strange is a fictional practicing sorcerer who draws his powers from mystical entities such as Agamotto, Cyttorak, Ikonn, Oshtur, Raggadorr, and Watoomb, who lend their energies for spells.

            In addition to his magical abilities, Strange is trained in several martial arts disciplines, including judo, and has shown proficiency with numerous magically conjured weapons including swords and axes. Strange was a skilled neurosurgeon before nerve damage impaired his hands.[

        <h1> Artifacts & Technology </h1>
        <article class="content">

             <h2>Book of the Vishanti</h2>
            <p> The greatest known source of white magical knowledge on Earth. The Book of the Vishanti contains spells of defensive magic and is indestructible.
                Even though the book is a tome of benevolent magic, the spells within can still be dangerous when used improperly. 
                Doctor Strange keeps the book in his town house library in New York City's Greenwich Village. He briefly lost the book when he destroyed his home to prevent the alien wizard Urthona from taking his magical artifacts, but the book was saved by Agamotto, who transported it to his realm and returned it to Strange some time later. 
            </p>
            <h2>Cloak of Levitation</h2>
            <p> A potent mystical cloak worn by Doctor Strange. The primary purpose of the cloak is to give its wearer the ability to levitate and fly. Additionally, the cloak is able to alter its shape, being often used to act as "another set of hands" to attack an opponent when Strange's own body has been incapacitated. 

            </p>
            <h2>Eye of Agamotto</h2>
            <p> Weapon of wisdom that can radiate a powerful mystical light that allows Strange to see through all disguises and illusions, see past events, and track both ethereal and corporeal beings by their psychic or magical emissions. The light given off by the Eye also weakens a variety of evil mystical beings, such as demons, devils, undead beings, dark extradimensional entities, and even sufficiently corrupt human practitioners of the Dark Arts.</p>
            
            <h2>Orb of Agamotto</h2>
            <p> Occult object that Doctor Strange owns. It is a powerful scrying crystal ball powered by the Agamotto entity to detect the use of magic anywhere in the world, providing Strange with a location and visual. It can also be used to monitor the shields that protect the planets created by the three sanctums. If Agamotto is inside the Orb, it becomes Strange's ultimate source of knowledge.</p>
