        <h1> Bio / Profile </h1>
        <article class="content">
           <p> Doctor Strange is a character that lives in Marvel Universe. Serves as Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats.
            He is first introduced as a brilliant but egotistically arrogant neurosurgeon who is injured in a car accident.
            He is told that medical therapy and rehabilitation won't be enough for his full recovery to go back to work, so, unable to accept this prognosis, he travels the world searching for alternative ways of healing, which leads him to the Ancient One, the Sorcerer Supreme.
            Then, he becomes his student and learns to be a master of both the mystical and the martial arts.
            He acquires an assortment of mystical objects, including the powerful Eye of Agamotto, and the Cloak of Levitation, then takes up residence in a mnsion referred to as the Sanctum Sanctorum, located in New York City.
            Strange assumes the title of Sorcerer Supreme, and, with his friend Wong, defends the world from mystical threats.

        <article class="content">
            <p>Doctor Strange is a fictional practicing sorcerer who draws his powers from mystical entities such as Agamotto, Cyttorak, Ikonn, Oshtur, Raggadorr, and Watoomb, who lend their energies for spells.

            In addition to his magical abilities, Strange is trained in several martial arts disciplines, including judo, and has shown proficiency with numerous magically conjured weapons including swords and axes. Strange was a skilled neurosurgeon before nerve damage impaired his hands.[

        <article class="content">

             <h3>Book of the Vishanti</h3>
                <p> The greatest known source of white magical knowledge on Earth. The Book of the Vishanti contains spells of defensive magic and is indestructible.
                Even though the book is a tome of benevolent magic, the spells within can still be dangerous when used improperly. 
                Doctor Strange keeps the book in his town house library in New York City's Greenwich Village. He briefly lost the book when he destroyed his home to prevent the alien wizard Urthona from taking his magical artifacts, but the book was saved by Agamotto, who transported it to his realm and returned it to Strange some time later. 
                </p>
            
            <h3>Cloak of Levitation</h3>
                <p> A potent mystical cloak worn by Doctor Strange. The primary purpose of the cloak is to give its wearer the ability to levitate and fly. Additionally, the cloak is able to alter its shape, being often used to act as "another set of hands" to attack an opponent when Strange's own body has been incapacitated. 
                </p>

            <h3>Eye of Agamotto</h3>
                <p> Weapon of wisdom that can radiate a powerful mystical light that allows Strange to see through all disguises and illusions, see past events, and track both ethereal and corporeal beings by their psychic or magical emissions. The light given off by the Eye also weakens a variety of evil mystical beings, such as demons, devils, undead beings, dark extradimensional entities, and even sufficiently corrupt human practitioners of the Dark Arts.</p>
            
            <h3>Orb of Agamotto</h3>
                <p> Occult object that Doctor Strange owns. It is a powerful scrying crystal ball powered by the Agamotto entity to detect the use of magic anywhere in the world, providing Strange with a location and visual. It can also be used to monitor the shields that protect the planets created by the three sanctums. If Agamotto is inside the Orb, it becomes Strange's ultimate source of knowledge.</p>

        <article class="content">
            
            <p>As the Sorcerer Supreme, a founder of the Defenders, and a member of the Avengers, Doctor Stephen Strange counts a great many foes who flat out hate him. Some he’s banished to hellish dimensions while others despise him for constantly foiling their plans. Take a look at the Sorcerer Supreme’s nastiest adversaries!
            </p>

            <h3>Baron Mordo</h3>

                <p>Doctor Strange’s first true foe proved to be Baron Mordo, a fellow Ancient One trainee who planned on killing their teacher. Also highly versed in the mystic arts, Mordo continually appears to offer his fellow pupil trouble.
                </p>
            <h3>Dormammu</h3>

                <p>When it comes to Doctor Strange villains, few hold a candle to the Dread Dormammu, ruler of the dark dimension. The Green Goblin to Strange’s Spider-Man, Dormammu refuses to let his long-simmering hatred for the Sorcerer Supreme cool down. His sister Umar also relishes tormenting the good doctor, so it must run in the family.
                </p>
            <h3>Satana</h3>
                <p>Daimon Hellstrom’s sister, Satana followed their devlish father’s way of life and studied the dark arts. While training in a hell dimension, Basilisk glommed on to her and remained until she saved Doctor Strange from the demon’s werewolf curse. Eventually she turned back to the dark side and will appear in DOCTOR STRANGE #14 alongside Master Pandemonium.
                </p>
            <h3>Nightmare</h3>

                <p>STRANGE TALES #110 not only introduced the world to Doctor Strange, but also the dream-wielding Nightmare, a creature who continues to pop up and make the Marvel Universe toss and turn to this day.
                </p>

            <h3>Mephisto</h3>

                <p>Mephisto and Doctor Strange have tussled a time or 12 over the years. The devil’s been involved in everything from Scarlet Witch and Vision’s fake children to the retconning of Peter Parker and Mary Jane's marriage, but he still holds a grudge for that time Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom saved the soul of the latter’s mother in TRIUMPH AND TORMENT.
                </p>

            <h3>Nameless One</h3>

                <p>The Nameless One and his minions, the Undying Ones proved so dangerous that Doctor Strange recruited help to defeat them in a 1970’s crossover with SUB-MARINER and INCREDIBLE HULK. That's right, without knowing it, this recurring entity accidentally paved the way for the Defenders to join forces and stop his evil plans time and time again.
                </p>

            <h3>Doctor Doom</h3>

                <p>Though not regular foes, the Doctors Strange and Doom do occasionally get into it with one another thanks to the villain’s propensity for magic. They actually worked well together in TRIUMPH AND TORMENT, but that didn't stop Stephen from worrying that the Latverian leader would become the next Sorcerer Supreme during the time that Stephen realized he’d lost the honor.
                </p>

            <h3>The Hood</h3>

                <p>At the height of his power during Dark Reign, The Hood made a deal with Dormammu that turned the gun-wielding villain into a next-level magic malevolence. He even attempted to grab the Eye of Agamotto when Strage proved unworthy, but fell to its new wielder: Doctor Voodoo.
                </p>

            <h3>Imperator</h3>
                <p>Leader of the magic-destroying Empirikul, Imperator nearly succeeded in destroying Doctor Strange and all of the mystic energy in our realm during “The Last Days of Magic.” Strange finally defeated him with the help of the Ancient One’s skull, but we wouldn't be surprised if he’s planning his next attack in one of those handy pocket dimensions.
